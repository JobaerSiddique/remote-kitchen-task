# Question 1: Hotfix Branch Naming and PR Process

### Branch Naming Convention
For submitting a hotfix, the branch should be named following the teamâ€™s convention. Typically, this involves a prefix indicating the branch type and a brief description of the issue being fixed. In this case, the branch name could be:

hotfix/fix-<PROBLEM-DESCRIPTION>



### Steps to Create a PR and Merge with Production
1. Create the Hotfix Branch name.then we follow the work.
I can try step by step understanding the git soluting with PR 
   1.First I can Check out to the main or production branch:
     git checkout main
    
   2. make a  Pull the latest changes:
     git pull origin main
     
   3.then  Create a new branch for the hotfix:
     
     git checkout -b hotfix/fix-<PROBLEM-DESCRIPTION>
     

 then second steps Make Changes and Commit
    Make the necessary changes to fix the issue.
   then Add the changes to the staging area
     
     git add .
     
    then commit for git so that any can understand which update or change Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
     
     git commit -m "Fix: <brief description of the fix>"
     

3. Push the Branch to Remote Repository
   - Push the hotfix branch to the remote repository:
     
     git push origin hotfix/fix-<issue-description>
     

4. **then Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on "New pull request".
   - Select the hotfix branch as the source branch and the main/production branch as the target branch.
   - Provide a clear title and description for the PR, detailing the changes made.
   - Request reviews from team members if necessary.

5. **Merge the PR**
   - After receiving the necessary approvals, merge the PR into the main/production branch.
   - Delete the hotfix branch after the merge to keep the repository clean.

6. **Verify the Changes**
   - Pull the latest changes on the main/production branch to ensure everything is up-to-date:
     
     git pull origin main
     

## Question 2: Finding Menu Items by Category

### Conceptual Approach
To find the specific items that belong to each category in the menu collections, follow these steps:

1. **Iterate Over Each Menu Collection**
   - Loop through each menu object in the array.

2. **Create a Mapping of Menu Item IDs to Items**
   - For each menu collection, create a dictionary or map where the key is the `id` of the menu item and the value is the menu item object itself.

3. **Match Menu Item IDs in Categories**
   - For each category in the menu collection, map the `menuItemsIds` to their corresponding menu items using the dictionary/map created in the previous step.

4. **Store the Results**
   - Create a new structure or update the existing one to store the category names along with their corresponding menu items.

### Example Walkthrough
Using the provided `dummyArr` as an example:

1. **Iterate Over Menu Collections**
   - We have two collections: Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian.

2. **Create Menu Item Map FOR OBJECT**
   - For Vegetarian:
     javascript
     {
       1: {id: 1, name: "Salad"},
       2: {id: 2, name: "Veg Burger"},
       3: {id: 3, name: "Pasta"}
     }
     ```

   - For Non-Vegetarian:
     javascript
     {
       4: {id: 4, name: "Chicken Wings"},
       5: {id: 5, name: "Beef Burger"},
       6: {id: 6, name: "Shrimp Pasta"}
     }
     ```

3. **FIRST WE TRY Match IDs in Categories**
   - For Vegetarian, in the "Starters" category, IDs [1, 2] map to "Salad" and "Veg Burger".
   - For Non-Vegetarian, in the "Main Course" category, IDs [4, 5] map to "Chicken Wings" and "Beef Burger".

4. **SECONDLY Store the Results**
   - Create an object or array to store the results:
     javascript
     {
       "Vegetarian": {
         "Starters": [
           {id: 1, name: "Salad"},
           {id: 2, name: "Veg Burger"}
         ]
       },
       "Non-Vegetarian": {
         "Main Course": [
           {id: 4, name: "Chicken Wings"},
           {id: 5, name: "Beef Burger"}
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

By following this approach, you can efficiently find and categorize menu items based on their IDs
